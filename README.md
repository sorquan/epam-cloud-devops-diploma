# Diploma task
Create a simple Web-application (see the description in the “Application” section below), CI/CD infrastructure and pipeline for it.
# Acceptance Criteria and presentation
A short presentation (.ppt or other) which contains description of the solution should be prepared and sent to the commission before a demo session.  
The working application with the pipeline is to be demonstrated live on a “protection of the diploma” session for experts with comments and explanation of the details of the implementation, reasons of choosing tools and technologies.
# Detailed requirements/criteria:
Criteria|Reqiurements|Related Module
-|-|-
SCM|Application sources should be placed in Git repository. Branching strategy should be explained.|Git
Tests*|CI pipeline may contain unit tests, smoke tests, linter check.|CI/CD
Quality gate|CI/CD pipeline should use some quality/vulnerability control tool like a Sonar or Anchore.	CI/CD
IaC|CI/CI and runtime infrastructure should be described as a code using Terraform, CloudFormation, or any similar tool. On the demonstration deployment procedure should be shown.|Cloud, Terraform, Ansible
Orchestration|All non cloud-native tools should be spinned up inside a K8S/OpenShift cluster inside a cloud. Application runtime environments should be inside the cluster too.|Kubernetes
Logging	| Infrastructure should have centralized log collection/display system. Logs of the application components and infra components should be collected.|Monitoring and Logging
Monitoring|Infrastructure should have centralized metric collection/display system. Metrics of the application components and infra components should be collected.|Monitoring and Logging
Runtime/Deployment|Runtime infrastructure should have production and non production environments.  Deploy/release strategy should be explained.|CI/CD
Scalability/redundancy|Scalability should be provided and demonstrated|Kubernetes
Cloud and Cost efficiency**|Cloud resources and services must be used for the task. Report about the Cloud resource usage and the cost must be provided in the presentation. It should be efficient (minimal) – in accordance to the solving tasks. You can choose any cloud provider taking into account possible extra costs for the resources.|Cloud

**Nice to have – optional*

***Be careful with the Cloud resource usage and check the costs for not to exceed limits! Switch off your machines when you are not using them!*

# Application
Develop a simple (lightweight) 3-tire application (front-end, back-end, database).

Back-end (collects data) must:
1. Retrieve a portion of data from API (see in your Variant) and store it in a database
2. Update data on demand
3. Update DB schema if needed on app’s update

Front-end (outputs data) must:
1. Display any portion of the data stored in the DB
2. Provide a method to trigger data update process

Database:  
1. Choose Database type and data scheme in a suitable manner. 
2. Data must be stored in a persistent way
3. It’s better to use cloud native DB solutions like an RDS/AzureSQL/CloudSQL.

# Variant 4
Using API https://covidtracker.bsg.ox.ac.uk/about-api get all data about “Country data for a specific day" for current year and 10 any countries and store it into your DB:

*date_value, country_code, confirmed, deaths, stringency_actual, stringency.*

Output the data by date (the date is set) in form of a table and sort them by deaths in ascending order.
